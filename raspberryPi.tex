\par The Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ is the latest product in the Raspberry Pi 3 range, weighing in at just 29 g. Like the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, it boasts a 64-bit quad core processor running at 1.4?GHz, dual-band 2.4?GHz and 5?GHz wireless LAN, and Bluetooth 4.2/BLE. The dual-band wireless LAN comes with modular compliance certification, allowing the board to be designed into end products with significantly reduced wireless LAN compliance testing, improving both cost and time to market. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ has the same mechanical footprint as the older Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+.

\subsubsection{Raspberry Pi Camera (Hardware and Software)}
\par The Raspberry Pi Camera v2 is the new official camera board released by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 is a high quality 8 megapixel Sony IMX219 imagesensor custom designed add-on board for Raspberry Pi, featuring a fixed focus lens. It's capable of 3280 x 2464 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p90 video. It attaches to Pi by way of one of the small sockets on the board upper surface and uses the dedicated CSi interface, designed especially for interfacing to cameras.

\end{figure}
\par This package provides a pure Python interface to the Raspberry Pi camera module for Python 2.7 (or above) or Python 3.2 (or above). It can configure resolution and give different dimensions to the video or picture files. It can also take photos under varying conditions if given the right parameters for a camera to take a good picture under different conditions such as lighting conditions. 
The code for the camera is as follows

\subsubsection{PiCamera difficulties}
\par Camera Component sends a camera control callback error and does not take and save pictures anymore. The OS of the raspberry pi has been reset and redownloaded to the raspberry pi. There is a visible trigger to the camera activating when using the Pi NOIR camera board. There is a red light on the board of the camera that signifies when it is turned on or activated. The camera when activated through the command window will sometimes create the file but have no data inside of it. Upon receiving this error it seems to slow down the raspberry pi board significantly that it requires a restart. The raspberry pi has been test with three different camera modules and all of them give back the same callback control error.  Raspberry Pi has configuration settings to activate and recognize when a camera is connected, however the issues may seem to arise with a faulty port on the raspberry pi itself.

\par When attempting to switch to audio recording instead of using the camera the only devices available were 3.5mm jack from a headset with built in microphone. The assumption was to connect to the audio jack output of the raspberry pi, and record and listen through the headset itself. However, this is impossible due to the specifications of the raspberry pi the audio jack is meant for output only. The only way to record audio was using a
