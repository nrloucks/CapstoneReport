\subsubsection{Performance Results}
	As demonstrated in the preceding sections of this report. Each element of our system functioned as-intended.
	\par The Gas detection unit was able to accurately measure not only gas presence, but also accurate part-per-million values for common liquid petroleum based gasses. This data was able to be transmitted and operated on in the python GUI.
	\par The Raspberry Pi and supporting module were able to interface with each other to trigger acquisition and transmission of various forms of media.
	\par The motion detection unit was able to detect movement at a variety of ranges, detect movement without constant sampling, transmit digital data used to trigger a response in the python GUI, as well as compensate for erroneous operations.
	\subsubsection{Conclusion}
	Overall this project was a success. Despite design challenges we were able to troubleshoot or find alternative solutions to new problems quickly and effectively. The change to remote learning took a toll on the rate at which we could accomplish certain aspects of the project, however through online collaboration we were able to successfully implement each aspect of our project. 
	\par It was an excellent learning experience that utilized a combination of skills and techniques learned in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program. It also shows a big project may be tackled by a team of engineers working in the field.
