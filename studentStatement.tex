As one of the final steps in the pursuit of our degrees, this project has been a long but rewarding process. The Spring 2020 semester was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. 
\par All of us, students and staff, were required to come up contingencies on short notice to facilitate the completion of our projects. As a result we needed to find solutions not only to the problems initially proposed, but also to the new problems created by the aberrant situation. 
\par Our erstwhile well planned timeline was thrown entirely out the window. Luckily, we had been ahead of schedule prior to the transition to remote collaboration. Within a short time we had a tentative plan to bring our system to fruition. Ultimately our end product lacks some functionality that was initially proposed due to a variety of extenuating factors, beyond our control.
